By the end of Sunday:
- FOR NOW IGNORE PRECISION;
- FOR NOW ONLY POSITIVE;

Louis:
- rewrite a bit the classifier to be used as FOL clauses for the matching; (make the expression)
- implement the model for the satisfy; (Slides 8)
- satisfy;

Roberto:
- from NL to FOL (with lambda.pl); (Slides 11)
- find a bit more authors;
- presentation done;


Monday:
- presentation recording;


Flow:
- program starts;
- user inputs the question and the text;
- classify the text and generate the FOL expression for the characteristics of the author (so everything we have);
- translate the question from NL to FOL with the lambda.pl file (slides 11) with a lambda wrapping around to inest the classifier done by the previous step;
- result for now: single FOL formula to get who is the author with matches the most characteristics;
- satisfy with a model with all our characteristics and authors (Slides 8) to retrieve the author;
- Result for the user: author;



Later:
- report;
























































































- (more questions);
